<h1 itemprop="applicationCategory">Fragrance Ratings Project</h1>

<p itemprop="operatingSystem">This program was created in Python with requests, BeautifulSoup, sqlite3 and pandas on Windows.</p>
<p itemprop="description">I was running out of the cologne I was using and decided that it was a good a time as any to get a new one. I was browsing a fragrance review site that was recommended to me when I realized something odd. I could search for certain ingredients or the person who designed the fragrance but in order to see what they were *rated* as, I'd have to actually click the link individually. Well, that made no sense to me. There are THOUSANDS of colognes on the market, how do I know which ones are the best ones that I should try?</p>
<p itemprop="description">I could Google a top ten list. But how do I know that the reviewer likes the same types of scents as me? Or maybe I could just randomly go to a brick and mortar store to sample. But each store only has a limited stock to sample and I could get whatever I want from the internet.</p>
<p itemprop="description">I wanted a solution that allowed me to make my own decision while also not limiting my options. So, I decided to create a program to scrape the review website and output a spreadsheet with all of the brands, names, amount of reviews and the rating (on a scale of 0 to 5). To speed up the program, I filtered for men's colognes and for colognes that had a non-zero amount of ratings. You can see the output in the spreadsheet below.</p>
